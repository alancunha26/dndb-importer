# RFCs (Requests for Comments)

This directory contains proposal documents for significant changes, features, and architectural decisions in the dndbeyond-importer project.

## Historical Documents

**RFCs are historical design documents** that capture the reasoning and decisions made during the planning phase. They are valuable for understanding original design intent and trade-offs considered.

**RFCs are not kept in sync with implementation changes.** As the codebase evolves, the actual implementation may diverge from the original RFC design. This is expected—implementation often reveals better approaches.

For current implementation details, refer to:
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - Development guide with architecture details
- [docs/](../) - Up-to-date documentation

## Process

1. **Create**: Copy `0000-template.md` and rename with the next number: `0001-your-feature.md`
2. **Draft**: Fill in the template with your proposal
3. **Review**: Share for feedback and iterate
4. **Decide**: Mark as Accepted or Rejected
5. **Update**: Keep as living documents during implementation
